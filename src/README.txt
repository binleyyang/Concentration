Project 3: Concentration

To display the 54 cards face down, I used a gridlayout and arrays to display the cards. I randomized or shuffled the cards with my shuffler method. If you select one of the radio buttons, a new type of game will be played. The replay button also resets the entire deck of cards to play again. If you select two cards that are the same value (i.e. two kings), then I disable the two cards. When playing against the computer, once you select two cards, the computer will automatically select two, and after a delay, the cards will fade out. The program also keeps track of the number of attempts made and the score for each player/computer.

To run the program, simply press run if yourre using an IDE, and compile and then execute if you're using command line.
